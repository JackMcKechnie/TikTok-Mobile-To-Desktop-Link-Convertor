# TikTok-Mobile-To-Desktop-Link-Convertor
An extremely simple and rudimental tool to convert TikTok mobile links into full desktop links. Niche, but it has its uses to find video IDs etc. Takes in a txt file of mobile links and outputs a txt file of desktop links. 

You will need to install Selenium for this tool, instructions on how to do so are here: https://www.seleniummaster.com/sitecontent/index.php/selenium-web-driver-menu/selenium-test-automation-with-python/186-how-to-install-selenium-python-webdriver. The comments in the file should be fairly self explanitory to make this function otherwise. If not, please do not hesitate to contact me.
